It's Sunday and you've forgotten to go to the grocery store, again.  The sun is shining and you're itching to grill up a feast in the park.  Forget it! Supermarkets aren't open on Sunday, dummy! Wait... some of them are! 

With sonntags you can find all the open supermarkets, Apotheke, bike shops, and more, as well as get notifications when all stores are allowed to open on Sunday during the year!
